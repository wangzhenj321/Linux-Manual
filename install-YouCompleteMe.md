First carefully read the [installation instructions](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/#installation) for your OS. We recommend you use the supplied *install.py*.

Next check the [User Guide](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/#user-guide) section on the semantic completer that you are using. For C/C++/Objective C, you must read [this section](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/#c-family-semantic-completion).

Finally, check the [FAQ](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/#faq).

## Prerequisites

**Ubuntu Linux x64**

These instructions (using *install.py*) are the quickest way to install YouCompleteMe, however they may not work for everyone. If the following instructions don't work for you, check out the [full installation guide](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/#full-installation-guide).

Make sure you have Vim 7.4.1578 with Python 2 or Python 3 support. Ubuntu 16.04 and later have a Vim that's recent enough. You can see the version of Vim installed by running `vim --version`. If the version is too old, you may need to [compile Vim from source](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source) (don't worry, it's easy).
